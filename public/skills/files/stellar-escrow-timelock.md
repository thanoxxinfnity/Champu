# Stellar Escrow and Timelock Architecture

**What it is:** Provides an auditable framework for conditional asset locking, timelock boundary verifications, and multi-signature release triggers on Stellar.

## Overview

Provides a standardized, auditable framework and data model for **Stellar Escrow and Timelock Architecture** operations across distributed engineering and decentralized application systems.

## When to Use This Skill

- When formalizing architectural contracts, security invariants, or operational limits for Stellar Escrow and Timelock Architecture.
- When cross-functional review is required between protocol developers, smart contract auditors, and AI engineering agents.
- When generating reproducible CSV, SQL DDL, JSON Schema, and Notion property registers for tracking compliance.

## How It Works

1. Define the parameters, thresholds, and identity bindings required for the target operational register.
2. Select appropriate boundary enforcement values from validated enum select sets.
3. Export standardized artifacts (CSV table, SQL DDL, JSON Schema) to integrate into validation CI pipelines.

| 4 | Arbitrator Account | `text` | `VARCHAR(56)` | `string` | Text | `GARB...` |
| 5 | Locked Asset Code | `text` | `VARCHAR(12)` | `string` | Text | `USDC` |
| 6 | Locked Principal Amount | `currency` | `NUMERIC(24,7)` | `number` | Number | `15000.0000000` |
| 7 | Unlock Timestamp Epoch | `number` | `BIGINT` | `number` | Number | `1790800000` |
| 8 | Dispute Resolution Pathway | `select` | `VARCHAR(64)` | `string` | Select | `2-of-3 Multi-Sig` |
| 9 | Clawback Grace Period Days | `number` | `INTEGER` | `number` | Number | `14` |
| 10 | Settlement Status | `select` | `VARCHAR(32)` | `string` | Select | `Locked in Escrow` |
| 11 | Creation Date | `date` | `DATE` | `string, format: date` | Date | `2026-10-01` |

## Examples

**Prompt**

```
How do I configure and track Stellar Escrow and Timelock Architecture for our production environment?
```

**Recommended Next Step**

> Generate the unified field schema, SQL DDL migration, and JSON validation schema to register into your system catalog.
>
> Workflow: Define criteria -> Run automated verification -> Record baseline -> Monitor invariants.

## Best Practices

- Enforce strict typing on numerical bounds and currency amounts; avoid unstructured free-text fields for critical states.
- Re-run validation test suites on every state-altering commit or parameter change.
- Keep example data synthetic and isolated from production cryptographic keys or private endpoints.

## Limitations

- Provides architectural specifications, data models, and verification schemas; does not execute direct transaction signing without authorized external tooling.
- Requires network connectivity and valid RPC credentials when querying on-chain states.

## Security & Safety Notes

- All parameters declare `risk: safe`. No unauthorized state modification or privileged credential access is performed.
- Use synthetic dummy keys and mock addresses in test suites and local verification scripts.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Mismatched decimal precision between contract runtime and database register.
  **Solution:** Always verify decimals using the explicit field mapping in this reference.
- **Problem:** Missing authorization checks prior to state update.
  **Solution:** Cross-validate against the Security Audit register before deployment.
