## Risk Scoring Model

```yaml
risk_scoring:
  dimensions:
    data_sensitivity:
      weight: 30
      scores:
        1: "No access to company or customer data"
        2: "Access to public or non-sensitive internal data"
        3: "Access to internal confidential data"
        4: "Access to PII or customer financial data"
        5: "Access to regulated data (PHI, PCI, classified)"

    system_access:
      weight: 25
      scores:
        1: "No system access"
        2: "Read-only access to non-production"
        3: "Read/write access to non-production or read-only production"
        4: "Read/write access to production systems"
        5: "Privileged/admin access to production or security systems"

    business_criticality:
      weight: 20
      scores:
        1: "No operational dependency"
        2: "Minor convenience; easily replaced"
        3: "Moderate dependency; replacement in weeks"
        4: "Significant dependency; replacement in months"
        5: "Critical dependency; no viable alternative"

    security_posture:
      weight: 15
      scores:
        5: "No certifications, no formal security program"
        4: "Some security controls but no external validation"
        3: "SOC 2 Type I or equivalent"
        2: "SOC 2 Type II within last 12 months"
        1: "Multiple certifications (SOC 2 + ISO 27001), strong program"

    regulatory_exposure:
      weight: 10
      scores:
        1: "No regulatory requirements"
        2: "General data protection (GDPR basic)"
        3: "Industry-specific (HIPAA, PCI)"
        4: "Government (FedRAMP, ITAR)"
        5: "Multiple stringent regulations"

  calculation:
    formula: "Sum of (dimension_score * dimension_weight) / 100"
    risk_levels:
      low: "Score 1.0 - 2.0"
      medium: "Score 2.1 - 3.0"
      high: "Score 3.1 - 4.0"
      critical: "Score 4.1 - 5.0"

  example:
    vendor: "Payment Processor X"
    data_sensitivity: 5  # PCI data
    system_access: 4     # Production API integration
    business_criticality: 5  # No alternative
    security_posture: 2  # SOC 2 Type II
    regulatory_exposure: 3   # PCI DSS
    score: "(5*30 + 4*25 + 5*20 + 2*15 + 3*10) / 100 = 4.1 -> Critical"
```
