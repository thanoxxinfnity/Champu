# agy-auto — Antigravity Auto-Permission & Security Gate

## Overview

`agy-auto` is a PreToolUse hook and security harness for Google Antigravity CLI (`agy`) that enables safe unattended execution without relying on `--dangerously-skip-permissions`. It passes every pending tool call through a multi-layered policy gate: deterministic hard-deny rules, deterministic fast-allow for workspace-scoped and read-only operations, an LLM classifier fallback (Gemini Flash Lite or local llama.cpp), and single-use scoped token approvals with Zero Ambient Authority.

## When to Use This Skill

- Use when running Antigravity CLI (`agy`) unattended or in background agent loops and you want automated tool permissions without exposing system files or credentials.
- Use when you need granular, auditable controls over shell commands, file modifications, and network egress during `agy` workflows.
- Use when setting up a secure pair-programming environment with Antigravity that prevents prompt injection attacks from escaping the workspace.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Review, Pin, and Install agy-auto

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Because `agy-auto` installs as an active PreToolUse hook on the permission evaluation path, never clone a mutable branch directly into your live plugin directory. Always clone to a temporary staging folder, pin an immutable release tag or commit SHA, and inspect the codebase before making the hook executable.

**Option A: Native Antigravity Plugin (Recommended)**
```bash
# 1. Clone into a temporary review directory and checkout an immutable release tag
git clone https://github.com/onkarbadve/agy-auto.git /tmp/agy-auto-review
cd /tmp/agy-auto-review
git checkout v0.2.0-alpha

# 2. Inspect hook.sh and engine/ files before deployment
less hook.sh
python3 -m unittest -v tests/test_engine.py

# 3. Once reviewed and verified, copy to the Antigravity plugin directory and set permissions
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/config/plugins/agy-auto
cp -r . ~/.gemini/config/plugins/agy-auto/
chmod +x ~/.gemini/config/plugins/agy-auto/hook.sh
```

Ensure `toolPermission: "always-proceed"` is configured in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json` so hooks can gate tool calls:
```json
{
  "toolPermission": "always-proceed"
}
```

**Option B: Global Hook via Installer**
```bash
# 1. Clone to an isolated location and pin release
git clone https://github.com/onkarbadve/agy-auto.git ~/.local/share/agy-auto
cd ~/.local/share/agy-auto
git checkout v0.2.0-alpha

# 2. Review and run the installer
chmod +x hook.sh
./install.sh                  # registers hook in hooks.json, sets always-proceed, runs smoke tests
```

### Step 2: Policy Evaluation Layers

`agy-auto` evaluates each tool invocation through sequential layers (first match wins):

1. **Hard Deny**: Immediately blocks recursive deletes outside workspace, credential reads (`~/.ssh`, `.env`, cloud tokens), git history rewrites (`push --force`, `rebase`), package publishing, system file writes (`/etc`, shell rc), and gate tampering.
2. **Fast Allow**: Immediately permits parsed read-only commands (`cat`, `grep`, `git status`) and workspace-confined writes without invoking an LLM.
3. **Classifier**: Ambiguous or grey-area commands fall through to an LLM classifier (Google Gemini 3.5 Flash Lite free tier, or a local `llama.cpp` / Ollama endpoint) that reviews the pending call against conversation context and fail-closes on timeout.
4. **Scoped Action Approval**: If a command is denied or needs human judgment, the engine issues a single-use 6-character action token bound strictly to `(tool, normalized_cmd, cwd)`. You approve it by replying `> agy-approve <token>` in chat. Conversational phrases like "yes" or "proceed" are ignored to prevent ambient authority leakage.

## Examples

### Example 1: Approving a Blocked Command

When an unclassified command is blocked, `agy-auto` outputs a token:
```text
tool call denied by pre-tool hook: [agy-auto/classifier] needs human approval: pip install requests. Reply '> agy-approve a1b2c3' in chat to proceed.
```
To authorize this specific command for a single run, reply directly in the chat:
```text
> agy-approve a1b2c3
```

### Example 2: Configuring a Local Model Backend

To run `agy-auto` completely offline using llama.cpp or Ollama instead of cloud APIs, edit `~/.gemini/config/agy-auto/policy.toml`:
```toml
[classifier]
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions"
model = "qwen2.5-coder:7b"
timeout_s = 20
```

### Example 3: Running Headless Invocations

When invoking `agy` in headless mode (`-p`), always pass `--add-dir` so `agy-auto` recognizes the workspace boundaries:
```bash
agy --add-dir . -p "Run test suite and fix failing cases"
```

## Best Practices

- ✅ Always keep `toolPermission: "always-proceed"` enabled so the pre-tool hook can intercept and gate every tool call.
- ✅ Add custom repetitive dev tools (e.g. specialized compilers, formatters) to `[fast_allow]` in `~/.gemini/config/agy-auto/policy.toml` for instant sub-millisecond execution.
- ✅ Pass `--add-dir <path>` when running headless commands (`agy -p`) to prevent false-positive path denials.
- ❌ Do not use `--dangerously-skip-permissions`; `agy-auto` provides safe autonomous execution without removing safety guardrails.
- ❌ Do not attempt conversational approval words ("approve", "proceed", "yes"); approvals strictly require the ephemeral action token.

## Common Pitfalls

- **Problem:** Commands fail with `path is outside the workspace` when running `agy -p`.
  **Solution:** Headless `agy` does not infer workspace roots automatically. Pass `--add-dir .` (e.g. `agy --add-dir . -p "..."`).
- **Problem:** Classifier fails closed with `policy classifier unavailable (The read operation timed out)`.
  **Solution:** Increase `timeout_s` in `~/.gemini/config/agy-auto/policy.toml` (especially when running local LLMs on integrated graphics), or verify your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- **Problem:** Changes to `policy.toml` or `hook.sh` are blocked by `[agy-auto/hard_deny]`.
  **Solution:** `agy-auto` enforces self-protection against agents tampering with the security gate. Edit policy files directly from your own shell.

## Limitations

- `agy-auto` only intercepts actions performed via tool calls (e.g. `run_command`, `write_to_file`); it cannot restrict internal LLM network reasoning or Antigravity's own internal context-gathering file reads.
- Requires `toolPermission: "always-proceed"` in Antigravity settings to ensure the PreToolUse hook intercepts all tool invocations.
- Shell parsing is conservative: complex pipelines with computed variable expansions that cannot be statically resolved will fall through to the LLM classifier or require manual token approval.
